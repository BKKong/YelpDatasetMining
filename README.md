# Yelp Dataset Mining

Yelp's dataset challenge provides a rich source of user-generated text data.
This project mainly analyzes Yelp's business and review text dataset in order
to:

1. Get an overview of Yelp business dataset and efficiently access the data
    needed for deeper data science projects.
2. Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gain insights from the
   user reviews text data, such as analyzing the similarity of reviews and
   analyzing the sentiment of the reviews.
3. Cluster restaurants into different subgroups such that restaurants within the
   same group are similar to each other, and restaurants in different groups are
   dissimilar from each other.
4. Build a restaurant recommender for users based on their rating history and/or
   restaurant similarity.
